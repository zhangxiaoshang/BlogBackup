### Instructions
**Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.**

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1,1,1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

`[1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,...]`

But what if we started with [0,0,1] as a signature? As starting with [0,1] instead of [1,1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

`[0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,...]`

Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if `n==0`, then return an empty array and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the [Xbonacci kata](http://www.codewars.com/kata/fibonacci-tribonacci-and-friends)

[Personal thanks to Professor Jim Fowler on Coursera for his awesome classes that I really recommend to any math enthusiast and for showing me this mathematical curiosity too with his usual contagious passion :)]
#### Examples

#### Sample Tests

```js
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([1,1,1],10),[1,1,1,3,5,9,17,31,57,105])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([0,0,1],10),[0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,44])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([0,1,1],10),[0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24,44,81])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([1,0,0],10),[1,0,0,1,1,2,4,7,13,24])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([0,0,0],10),[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([1,2,3],10),[1,2,3,6,11,20,37,68,125,230])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([3,2,1],10),[3,2,1,6,9,16,31,56,103,190])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([1,1,1],1),[1])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([300,200,100],0),[])
Test.assertSimilar(tribonacci([0.5,0.5,0.5],30),[0.5,0.5,0.5,1.5,2.5,4.5,8.5,15.5,28.5,52.5,96.5,177.5,326.5,600.5,1104.5,2031.5,3736.5,6872.5,12640.5,23249.5,42762.5,78652.5,144664.5,266079.5,489396.5,900140.5,1655616.5,3045153.5,5600910.5,10301680.5])
```

### Normal Solution

```js
function tribonacci(signature,n){
  //your code here
  if (n === 0) {return []};
  if (n === 1) {return signature.slice(0, 1)};
  if (n === 2) {return signature.slice(0, 2)};
  if (n === 3) {return signature};
  while (signature.length < n) {
  	let len = signature.length;

  	signature.push(signature[len - 1] + signature[len - 2] + signature[len - 3])
  }

  return signature;
}
```

### Elegant Solution

```js
function tribonacci(signature,n){
  //your code here
  for (let i = 0; i < n - 3; i++) {
  	signature.push(signature[i] + signature[i + 1] + signature[i + 2])
  }

  return signature.slice(0, n);
}
